# How to survive low tier college (and be ahead of everyone) in 2026 or beyond:

 1. Start your college as usual - First week of the first semester

	- identify reliable and useless people and establish a connection. (A big plus if connections involve seniors)
	- find a one regular person that you can turn into your pet, so he will help you no matter what, while you're absent.
	- attend just for a week or two, then stop going college till the semester exams.

 2. THE Plan:

	- Get your syllabus together.
	- Start preparing entire course and take one entire semester to finish 1 year of syllabus. (don't work TOO hard on this, just minimal effort would do)
	- Every week - 3 days for college course, remaining 4 days for Step 3.
	- keep checking up on your pet every so often to catch up with classes (such as tests, assignments, etc.)
	- ask for every class notes PDF / pictures
	- do not take more than one day for assignments. (ez-pz)
	
 3. THE REAL REAL Plan:
	- Enroll for courses relevant your job.
	- Now Team up with your reliable connections (not the pet) and share useful knowledge, resources etc.
	- **make use of time to upskill before new semester starts**
	- your connections will be your die hard friends now
	- the pet should not know about your plans, keep a good distance but return to catch up with classes.
	- make good use of the pet for practical exams as well, make sure your friends use the pet as well, the pet will never complain
	- repeat step 2 and 3 until final year

4. The beginning of the end: 
	- Final year begins, start being regular (optional but recommended)
	- make sure to use the pet to maximum capacity, remember the pet never complains but seeks validation, burn him out, 
	  he will make mistakes, make sure you blame him properly
	- Your course might have projects, again the pet will be very useful here
	- smoothly pass through your exams while getting a decent percentage , (follow step 3)  
	- if you followed step 3, you are now a job-ready student even before graduation

 5. Spread your wings, and fly high:

	- dispose your pet
	- apply for jobs, internships 
  - get hired (probably)
	- (optional) prepare for masters
	- repeat through step 1 if you decide to do a master degree, but it is not recommended if you go to a higher tier college
